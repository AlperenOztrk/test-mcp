# üîÑ Iterative Agentic AI Implementation

## üéØ Overview

This project now features a **truly iterative agentic AI** that implements the **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting), similar to your Python example. The agent thinks, plans, and executes multiple steps until it completely solves the customer's problem.

## üß† ReAct Pattern Implementation

### Core Concept
The agent follows a **Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation** loop:

1. **Thought**: Agent reasons about what to do next
2. **Action**: Agent executes a tool or communicates with the customer  
3. **Observation**: Agent receives the result and continues thinking
4. **Repeat**: Until the problem is completely solved

### Example Agent Flow
```
Customer: "Hi, I'm John Smith. What's happening with my application?"

Thought: The customer provided their name and is asking about their application. I should look up their applications first.
Action: getCustomerApplications("John Smith")
Observation: [{"applicationId": "APP-12345", "cardName": "Chase Sapphire Preferred", "status": "PENDING", "processingDays": 8}]

Thought: I found John has an application that's been pending for 8 days. This seems longer than usual, so I should check the detailed status.
Action: getApplicationStatus("APP-12345")
Observation: [{"status": "FINAL_REVIEW", "statusMessage": "Additional income verification completed"}]

Thought: The status shows it's in final review. Let me get the approval time estimate to give John a complete update.
Action: estimateApprovalTime("APP-12345")
Observation: [{"success": true, "message": "Should be approved within 2-3 business days", "estimatedDaysRemaining": 2}]

Final Answer: Hi John! I found your application for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card from 8 days ago. Good news - it's currently in final review and should be approved within 2-3 business days. The delay was due to additional income verification, which has now been completed. You'll receive an email confirmation once approved, followed by your card within 7-10 business days. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your application?
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### New Components

#### 1. `IterativeAgentService.java`
- **Purpose**: Core iterative agent logic implementing ReAct pattern
- **Key Features**:
  - Agent loop with max 10 iterations (prevents infinite loops)
  - Thought/Action/Observation parsing
  - Tool execution and result interpretation
  - Natural language generation for final answers

#### 2. `IterativeAgentController.java`
- **Purpose**: REST endpoints for the iterative agent
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/iterative-agent/chat` - Main chat endpoint
  - `GET /api/iterative-agent/conversation/{sessionId}` - Get conversation history
  - `DELETE /api/iterative-agent/conversation/{sessionId}` - Clear conversation
  - `GET /api/iterative-agent/sessions` - Get active sessions
  - `GET /api/iterative-agent/health` - Health check
  - `GET /api/iterative-agent/info` - Agent capabilities

#### 3. Enhanced Web Interface
- **Agent Mode Selection**: Choose between "Iterative" and "Standard" agents
- **Real-time Mode Display**: Shows current agent mode in session info
- **Dual Endpoint Support**: Routes requests to appropriate agent based on selection

## üîß Implementation Details

### Agent Loop Logic
```java
private String runAgentLoop(String userMessage, ConversationContext context) {
    List<AgentStep> agentHistory = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Add initial user message
    agentHistory.add(new AgentStep("user_input", userMessage, ""));
    
    int iteration = 0;
    while (iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
        iteration++;
        
        // Build prompt with history
        String prompt = buildAgentPrompt(agentHistory, context);
        
        // Get agent's next step
        String agentResponse = callOpenAi(prompt);
        
        // Check if agent is done
        if (agentResponse.contains("Final Answer:")) {
            return extractFinalAnswer(agentResponse);
        }
        
        // Parse and execute action
        AgentStep step = parseAgentStep(agentResponse);
        String observation = executeAction(step);
        step.setObservation(observation);
        
        // Add to history for next iteration
        agentHistory.add(step);
    }
    
    return "Agent reached max iterations without completing";
}
```

### Response Format Enforcement
The agent is instructed to follow this exact format:

```
Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [tool_name(parameters) OR "communicate"]

OR for communication:
Action: communicate
Message: [Your message to the customer]

OR when done:
Final Answer: [Your complete solution/response to the customer]
```

### Tool Execution
```java
private Object executeToolCall(String toolName, String argsString) {
    switch (toolName) {
        case "getCards":
            return mcpCardService.getCards();
        case "getCustomerApplications":
            String customerName = argsString.trim().replaceAll("\"", "");
            return mcpCardService.getCustomerApplications(customerName);
        // ... other tools
    }
}
```

## üåü Key Features

- Can use multiple tools in sequence (e.g., look up customer ‚Üí check application status ‚Üí estimate approval time)
- Adapts tool usage based on what it discovers

### 3. **Natural Communication**
- Explains what it's doing when using tools
- Provides context and reasoning in responses
- Maintains conversational flow throughout the process

### 4. **Multilingual Support**
- Works in any language the customer uses
- Maintains cultural context and appropriate formality
- No hardcoded language limitations

### 5. **Context Building**

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complex Customer Inquiry
**Input**: "Hi, I'm Jane Smith. I applied for a card last week but haven't heard anything. Should I be worried?"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. **Thought**: Customer provided name and mentioned application - need to look up their applications
2. **Action**: `getCustomerApplications("Jane Smith")`
3. **Thought**: Found application from 8 days ago, longer than usual - check detailed status
4. **Action**: `getApplicationStatus("APP-67890")`
5. **Thought**: Status shows pending verification - get approval estimate to reassure customer
6. **Action**: `estimateApprovalTime("APP-67890")`
7. **Final Answer**: Comprehensive response with status, timeline, and next steps

### Scenario 2: Multilingual Support
**Input (Spanish)**: "Hola, soy Carlos Rodriguez. ¬øCu√°l tarjeta tiene el mejor bono?"

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. **Thought**: Customer asking about best bonus in Spanish - get bonus information
2. **Action**: `getBonuses()`
3. **Thought**: Got bonus data, need to analyze and present in Spanish
4. **Final Answer**: Natural Spanish response comparing bonuses and making recommendations

### Scenario 3: Application Submission
**Input**: "I want to apply for a credit card. I'm Mike Johnson, I make $75,000 per year, and I was born on 1985-03-15."

**Expected Agent Behavior**:
1. **Thought**: Customer wants to apply and provided all required information - can submit application
2. **Action**: `submitApplication("Mike", "Johnson", 75000, "1985-03-15")`
3. **Thought**: Application submitted successfully - provide confirmation and next steps
4. **Final Answer**: Application confirmation with ID, timeline, and what to expect
